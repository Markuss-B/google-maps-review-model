There were different levels of tickets you could purchase, but we just did the general and it was great. We didn't use a tour guide but still had a good experience. There is a lot to read as you go throughout. It's also really big! An amazing piece of history. When we were here in March 2025 there was still a considerable amount of construction going on, but it didn't really impact the experience. Also tickets are timed so be prepared to wait if you show up early. We got there a little early so we had to wait,  which we didn't mind. It was fun to wait outside and look around. A must see if you are here!"}

She was very knowledgeable and had photo book of recreations of what it would have looked like in there and in the Roman Forum part of the tour. I also got online 30 days in advance and was able to get Colosseum Attic tickets on a different day! Totally worth it. Amazing views! You can see everything from up there."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"This place is amazing. Almost didn't buy a ticket to go inside but I'm glad I did. LOTS of people at the beginning including a ton of people doing guided tours. I'm sure there's a bunch of good information but I just did it solo. When you're on the second level keep walking, don't bother fighting the hoards of people in the first little turnout. You can get a good view from further down. I made the mistake of fighting huge groups of people to get a picture, but there was much more space later on. In all my travels I don't think I've ever seen the amount of people as I did here. With that being said, it still was definitely worth it. I came here at the end of April and it was pretty warm. I can't imagine what if would be like in the hot hot summer. Get the 24 hr pass. You can walk over to see the Roman Forum afterwards."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":4,"text":"GUYS, I REPEAT FOR THE LAST TIME! BE SURE TO BUY TICKETS ONLINE, DON'T STAND IN THE LONGEST LINES OF YOUR LIVES!\n\nThe Colosseum is one of those places you think you know‚Äîuntil you actually stand in front of it. No photo or documentary can capture the feeling of being there in person. It‚Äôs massive, ancient, and honestly, kind of surreal. You can almost hear the echoes of the crowd, the clashing of swords, and imagine what it must have been like during the gladiator games.\n\nWalking through the arches and up the old stone steps feels like stepping back in time. It gave me chills just thinking about how much history this place has witnessed. The views from the upper levels are also incredible‚Äîyou can see across much of ancient Rome.\n\nI definitely recommend getting a guided tour or at least an audio guide. There‚Äôs so much history and detail that‚Äôs easy to miss otherwise. Also, try to go early or later in the day to avoid the heat and the biggest crowds. And bring water, especially in summer‚Äîit gets hot.\n\nEven with the tourists around, the atmosphere is powerful. The Colosseum is more than just a ruin; it‚Äôs a symbol of both the greatness and the brutality of the Roman Empire. Whether you‚Äôre into history or just visiting for the experience, it‚Äôs a must-see."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"The Colosseum is a breathtaking historical marvel, offering a glimpse into ancient Rome's grandeur.\n\nThe tickets queues can get very long very quickly so one can opt for skip-the-line tickets to avoid long queues.\n\nYou may consider exploring the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill nearby for a wholesome experience.\n\nGuided tours are also available for in-depth storytelling and exclusive access to restricted areas like the underground chambers and arena floor. There are also night tours, which provide a unique perspective of the Colosseum under moonlight, making for a delightful, and quite different experience.  All in all, the Colosseum is not to be missed."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Truly amazing! A must see if you are in Rome and love history. Highly recommend to buy tickets a couple of days before. They do sell ticket on site but those can run out and the lines to get them can be long. There the general admission only gives access to 3 levels, while the underground level is extra along with a semi private tour of the forum."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"An absolute must if you are in Rome, explore the different floors with the upper floor also offering great views of the surrounding area. We didn't book tickets in advance so were a bit worried but managed to get tickets with only about 10-15 minutes of queuing and then straight in for 18 euros. Need to be careful on the way in as people with tourist guide batches will offer to get you in quicker and with a guided tour but charge way over the odds so would suggest play it safe and book online in advance."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"The Colosseum is a must-see in Rome‚Äîhuge, historic, and impressive. Definitely buy your ticket well in advance to avoid sellouts. Give yourself about 1.5 hours to explore, and consider an audio guide if you‚Äôre into history. Wear comfy shoes; there‚Äôs a fair bit of walking and climbing. Well worth the visit!"}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Absolutely amazing tour! Family ranging from 7-70s, the organisation was fantastic from the start, clear meeting point and instructions of the tour. The tour guide was superb, she explained the area, gave lots of insights throughout the route. The tour included the visit to the Forum, ruins, pallastine hill and full colesseum tour including the underfloor. Not cheap but superb value! It was the best tour of the visit by far. The underground is exceptional,  seeing and walking in history... Absolutely amazing tour, highly recommend."}

I don‚Äôt think I need to tell you more, you know how incredible it is!"}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":4,"text":"The Colosseum is a stunning historical monument that I highly recommend visiting. It‚Äôs best to purchase your tickets online in advance, as this will save you from waiting in long queues. When you arrive, your ticket will be checked along with your ID, and after that, you can easily enter and start exploring.\n\nI found the visit incredibly fascinating. I was able to see most parts of the Colosseum, including the underground levels, the middle floors, and the upper sections. There‚Äôs also a public drinking water fountain inside, which I found really interesting‚Äîit used to be a natural spring in ancient times. That little detail added even more charm to the experience for me.\n\nAccess to the Colosseum is also very easy. Several different bus lines pass right in front of it, making transportation convenient. In addition, the surrounding streets are full of lovely local caf√©s and restaurants offering delicious food at reasonable prices. It‚Äôs a great area to enjoy a meal before or after your visit."}

Fantastic and you will wonder how beautiful it is."}

The Colosseum was one of the most impressive sites we saw‚Äîtruly a colossal structure, which is where its name originates. We went with Crown Tours, and they were very professional. Our guide, a young gentleman, was excellent‚Äîknowledgeable and patient with all our questions. Standing where the emperor would have sat during the games offered an unforgettable view of the arena."}

It was one of the most crowded places we went to but it was still early in the season so it was manageable"}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"An amazing must see for anyone visiting Rome. I recommend coming on a tour so that you get the wealth of history and knowledge that the tour guides have to offer. It really enhances the experience greatly. Also in a group you skip the line which has a que that would take well over an hour. With a tour you also get exclusive access to certain areas like the underground, walkways around where the seats used to be, and access to the middle ground where gladiators used to fight."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"The history here lingers in the air. Private tour is a must, which includes your ticket. It gets hot and not much room to hide from the sun when it busy.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Romes greatest and most iconic place to visit. You can see it best from the museum in the middle of the city if you go up to the terrace level (see picture) but we did go inside. You must have a passport with you, there are x-ray machines and metal detectors. If you can go with the least amount of stuff, you will have no problem. It's really something. The self tour is 75 minutes long inside and it exits to Constantine's arc. Very neat and lots to see."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"An amazing experience.  It was very busy, as you might expect, but well worth it.  One of those iconic places to visit and an impressive reminder of the might of the Roman Empire.  We had a timed entry, so getting in did not take too much time, and there was a well managed flow of people around the colosseum.  Plenty of information about it inside in multiple languages.  You can get a combined ticket to visit some of the other attractions and we‚Äôd just visited the Forum."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"The Colosseum! One of the 7 wonders of the new world! Now I‚Äôm not a fan of brutal history, but I‚Äôm a fan of popularity. We went during off peak (early May on a Tuesday ) so I honestly think it wasn‚Äôt that bad. Do the underground tour! Book months in advanced I heard it‚Äôs really fun and it‚Äôs great to see a different side of the infamous stadium. Try to keep walking towards the end. Not in the beginning where everyone is. It was hard to get photos when there were a bunch of people. The view was no different from the middle or the side. The side a lot less people and better photos without a bystander. Great spots for picture opportunities and so beautiful and glorious to see with your own two eyes. Do it! See the world, see the 7 wonders and more! Cheers!"}

The tickets can be booked online and costs around 18 Euros and photo ID is must as they check at the entrance.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"My opening advice is have a guide, pay for the tour, do not go it alone. Though you can get in by just buying a ticket, the experience will be enhanced by having a guide. This impressive structure boasts 2000 years of history and resiliency. It is a must see in Rome so you can experience the size and grandeur that once existed. A good guide will tell you what you are seeing, but also what was and how it evolved to the structure it is today."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":4,"text":"Visit out of season to avoid all of the idiotic tourists who wander around, unaware of others personal space.\n\nToo many tour groups stand in the middle of walkways - the company should have a 'tour group route' and an 'individual' route; or at least make the tour guides be more aware of their groups surroundings and stand to one side when they are providing information.\n\nAs with the rest of Rome and tourist spots, I'm not entirely sure what the ticket prices go towards... Many areas are closed entirely, or you have to pay more money to access certain areas. I understand restoration costs money, but it seems the same as it did when I first visited 20 years ago so this money clearly goes to someone's pocket rather than making it a pleasure to visit.\n\nIt's a good historical landmark though, I just wish it was better coordinated by the local authority."}

My child was fascinated by the stories of gladiators and kept asking questions about what had happened there, which made our visit even more engaging.\n\nSome parts can get crowded, but once you find the right angle, it‚Äôs a fantastic spot for family photos. I highly recommend heading to the upper levels for a panoramic view of the entire arena ‚Äì it‚Äôs both breathtaking and memorable. Just make sure to bring water and a sun hat, as Rome can get scorching hot in summer!\n\nOverall, whether you‚Äôre traveling as a family or just exploring on your own, the Colosseum offers a glimpse into history while also creating fun memories for the kids.

As one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, it carries an immense historical and cultural significance. Standing in front of this ancient amphitheater, you can‚Äôt help but feel a sense of awe. The scale, the structure, and the history that surrounds it are absolutely overwhelming in the best way.\n\nBuilt nearly 2,000 years ago, the Colosseum was the center of entertainment in Ancient Rome, hosting gladiator battles, public spectacles, and dramatic performances. Even though large portions of it are in ruins, the grandeur of its design still shines through. The architecture is remarkably advanced for its time, and walking through the corridors and seating areas makes it easy to imagine the roaring crowds and epic battles that once took place there.\n\nWhat‚Äôs truly impressive is how well the structure has held up. Restoration efforts have helped preserve its integrity, and there‚Äôs a great mix of original ruins and reconstructed elements to help you visualize its past glory. Informative signs and available guided tours also enhance the experience by providing rich historical context.\n\nThe atmosphere around the Colosseum is lively yet respectful. You‚Äôll find tourists from all over the world, all united in admiration. It's also beautifully lit at night, making it a wonderful sight even from the outside.\n\nThe surrounding area is filled with other historical sites like the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill, so it‚Äôs worth spending several hours or even a full day in the area.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre a history lover, an architecture enthusiast, or just someone curious about the past, the Colosseum is a must-visit. It‚Äôs not just a monument‚Äîit‚Äôs a journey back in time, and one of the most unforgettable landmarks in Italy."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Certainly, here's a review of the Colosseum with historical details, in English:\n\nThe Colosseum undeniably stands as an imposing symbol of ancient Rome and a breathtaking landmark. Visiting this magnificent amphitheater is a journey through time, conjuring images of gladiatorial contests, spectacles, and the daily life of an empire that once dominated the world.\n\nThe history of the Colosseum is deep and fascinating. Its construction began under Emperor Vespasian in 72 AD and was completed by his son, Titus, in 80 AD. Originally known as the Flavian Amphitheater, it could accommodate up to 80,000 spectators, making it the largest amphitheater in the Roman world. For centuries, it served as the epicenter of entertainment in Rome, hosting gladiatorial combats, wild animal hunts, and even mock sea battles (when the arena was flooded with water).\n\nWalking through its corridors and gazing upon the arena, it's easy to imagine the clamor and excitement of the ancient crowds. The intricate arches, the underground structures that housed the animals and gladiators, and the sheer scale of the building testify to the remarkable engineering and architectural prowess of the Romans.\n\nDespite the damage it has sustained from earthquakes and the passage of time, the Colosseum retains its imposing presence. The atmosphere is filled with awe and respect for the history it holds. The view from the upper levels offers a panoramic vista of Rome, connecting the ancient with the modern.\n\nWithout a doubt, a visit to the Colosseum is an experience not to be missed. It is a living history lesson, an opportunity to come into contact with the grandeur of an empire that left an indelible mark on global civilization. Its impressive architecture and rich history make it a destination that inspires awe and wonder."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":3,"text":"The Colosseum is truly a gigantic and awe-inspiring structure ‚Äî it can easily take hours to explore all the levels. We were lucky to have tickets that included access to the attic, which offered some unique views. Unfortunately, we couldn‚Äôt get the underground tickets, and in hindsight, those would have made for a much better experience, especially to fully appreciate the main arena.\n\nThat said, be prepared: it was extremely hot when we visited, and the crowds were intense. The heat and the number of people definitely made the experience less enjoyable. If you‚Äôre planning a visit, try to go early in the day or during the off-season, and book those underground tickets in advance!"}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":3,"text":"If you are very much into history of it all, you will definitely have a better experience. As a person who isn't a history buff, my unbiased opinion is - it was okay. Definitely a marvel to look on the outside, but inside lacks presentation. Sadly, as with many Rome's sights, the organization is not the best. The crowds are out of proportion and I constantly had a feeling that so many people shouldn't be allowed all at once in one place (I went midday because all early tickets were sold out a week in advance). I wish there was more to it is all I could say. If you didn't have a guide or a tour, it would really seem boring to you as there is barely any signs or interesting material to read or watch. I wish there was more focus on teaching visitors about the colloseum in a more interactive fashion because it's desperately needed here. You cannot just follow an audio guide because anytime you would want to see something, there are 100+ people in front of you blocking the views. All pics I took is by either waiting 20 min in 1 spot for someone to leave or by holding my hands up high like at a concert. In the end, my opinion is I loved seeing the colloseum from the outside and learning about it on my own through YouTube, which was actually more enjoyable than going inside."}

To see it with your own eyes, to touch the ancient stones, and to imagine the events that took place here‚Äîit‚Äôs nothing short of awe-inspiring. The sheer scale of the amphitheater is breathtaking. Honestly, I had expected it to be much smaller, but its size is massive, with countless arches and entrances that once accommodated tens of thousands of people.\nWhat truly struck me was the complexity of its design. It‚Äôs astounding to think that the Roman Empire, over two thousand years ago, had reached such a high level of architectural and engineering expertise. From the underground levels to the carefully planned tiers, every detail was so well thought out. The fact that they could envision and create something so grand and functional at that time is mind-blowing.\nStanding there, surrounded by this incredible structure, you can‚Äôt help but wonder where the knowledge and ingenuity came from to build something of this magnitude.

Our guide was really good at pointing things out and explaining what each part used to be. They gave us a clear picture of what it was like when gladiators fought and crowds of people came to watch. It wasn't just a simple story; they explained the different types of fights and even some of the politics behind it all, which was more interesting than I expected.\n\nGoing inside and seeing the different levels and the underground parts was fascinating. The guide helped us imagine what it would have been like for the people and the animals back then. You could really picture the noise and the excitement. They also explained how it was built and how long it took, which gave me a better appreciation for the engineering skills they had.\n\nIt wasn't just about the fighting, though. The guide also talked about other things that happened in the Colosseum and how it was used over time.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":4,"text":"The Colosseum, also called the Flavian Amphitheatre, is one of the most enduring symbols of ancient Rome. Built between AD 72 and 80 under the emperors Vespasian and Titus, it rises majestically in the center of Rome as a masterpiece of Roman architecture and engineering. Crafted from stone and concrete, it could seat up to 80,000 spectators and hosted a wide range of public events.\n\nThe arena was famous for its gladiator contests, wild animal hunts, and dramatic reenactments. Beneath the floor lay a vast underground network where animals and fighters waited before being raised into the arena through trapdoors. On some occasions, the Colosseum was even flooded for mock naval battles. It was a place of entertainment but also of bloodshed and brutality.\n\nAmong the darker chapters of its history, the Colosseum is remembered for the persecution of early Christians.  Christians were martyred here, thrown to wild beasts or executed in front of roaring crowds during times of imperial persecution. Today, a cross stands within the Colosseum as a memorial to those who suffered and died.\n\nDespite centuries of damage from earthquakes, neglect, and the stripping of its stone, the Colosseum remains a majestic ruin. Recognized as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, it draws millions of visitors every year. It stands not only as a testament to the grandeur of ancient Rome but also as a symbol of resilience and the enduring power of history."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"The Colosseum is Rome‚Äôs original multipurpose arena, brought to you by 1st-century imperial ego and a bloodlust budget that would make Hollywood blush. Built in eight years, because apparently slave labor and divine confidence are the ultimate project management tools.\n\nIt‚Äôs officially called the Flavian Amphitheater, but let‚Äôs be honest ‚ÄúColosseum‚Äù just sounds cooler. Probably because it was built next to a colossal statue of Nero, who thought the best way to be remembered was to build a 100-foot-tall bronze version of himself. What a humble guy.\n\nAnyway, the Colosseum. It‚Äôs big. It‚Äôs round(ish). It‚Äôs missing a few chunks thanks to earthquakes, vandals, and that one time the Catholic Church thought it‚Äôd make a great quarry. Yes, parts of your local church may literally be made from ancient death-sport arena scraps. Blessings all around. Some for you, some for me.\n\nInside? Back in the day, it seated 50,000 people who came to watch their favorite Netflix series: Live Gladiator Fights, Season Infinity. Lions? Check. Naval battles? Yup, they flooded the place. Prisoners forced to reenact mythology with a 100% fatality rate? That‚Äôs dinner and a show.\n\nModern visitors are now obsessed with its bones, snapping selfies while ignoring the fact that this is essentially a 2,000-year-old murder dome. And yet, there‚Äôs something romantic about it.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":3,"text":"Our recent attempt to outsmart the crowds at the Colosseum by visiting in the morning proved to be a largely futile exercise in managing expectations. While the iconic structure itself lived up to its grandeur, the promise of a less-crowded experience before the midday rush simply didn't materialize.\nArriving in the morning, we were immediately greeted by a significant volume of people already congregating around the entrance. Adding to the congestion was what appeared to be a large organized \"walking event,\" a considerable group moving together, further swelling the numbers and creating a somewhat chaotic atmosphere before even entering. It seems the secret of an early visit is, unfortunately, out ‚Äì and widely adopted by tour operators.\nOur entry process was a frustrating preview of the disorganization to come. We endured at least three separate checks of our tickets before even reaching the security screening. The security area itself was a scene of considerable chaos. Unlike more organized systems where bins are provided for personal items, here it felt like a free-for-all before the X-ray machine. We witnessed one unfortunate American visitor lose his credit card in the scramble, a direct consequence of the lack of a proper system for temporarily placing belongings. This chaotic bottleneck significantly detracted from the start of the visit.\nArmed with basic tickets, our eventual entry into the Colosseum, while successful, still involved navigating a considerable queue even after the multiple checks and security scrum. Once inside, the sheer number of visitors on the accessible ground and second floors was undeniable. While the historical significance and architectural marvel of the interior were certainly impactful, the experience was undoubtedly hampered by the constant jostling and the challenge of finding moments for quiet contemplation amidst the throng. The basic ticket provided decent access to key areas, offering impressive perspectives of the arena and the structure's immense scale, but the crowds made it difficult to fully immerse oneself.\nThe plan to continue our historical journey to the Roman Forum immediately after felt overly ambitious in the face of reality. The line snaking its way towards the Forum entrance was prohibitively long. After the already crowded Colosseum experience and the frustrating entry process, the prospect of another lengthy wait was unappealing, leading to the disappointing decision to skip the Forum altogether. This was a significant drawback, as the combined ticket is intended to offer a seamless visit to both sites.\nIn conclusion, a morning visit to the Colosseum, while allowing access to this incredible historical site, is far from a peaceful or crowd-free experience. The notion of avoiding the masses by arriving early seems to be a myth, at least during peak times or when large tour groups are operational. The entry and security process can be disorganized and frustrating, with multiple checks and inadequate provisions for handling personal belongings. The basic ticket grants access to the main levels, which are impressive but heavily populated. Be prepared for significant queues, not just for entry but potentially for onward sites like the Roman Forum, making flexible planning or alternative entry strategies (like guided tours with skip-the-line access, though these come at a higher cost and still involve being part of a group) potentially worthwhile considerations for those seeking a less congested visit and a more streamlined entry. Skipping the Roman Forum due to excessive lines remains a regrettable outcome of the crowded morning conditions and the inefficiencies encountered."}

The underground tour, if you can get it, is well worth it. A different perspective. The only negative I would say is that, while it's billed as a big deal, the arena floor, well it's not much of a space and I don't really get why it attracts an additional ticket.

It stands as the largest ancient amphitheater ever constructed and remains the world‚Äôs largest extant amphitheater. We secured tickets granting access to the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, and Roman Forum, including reserved Colosseum entry at our designated time. We examined the tiered seating from which Roman citizens witnessed the battles. We toured the Level 2 museum, which houses artifacts from the Colosseum. Our itinerary then took us to the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill, allowing for an examination of the ruins of various structures, including temples, markets, and palaces, and the ancient gateway to Rome, marked by two statues of horses on a white arch. Construction commenced in 72 AD; the structure attained a height of 159 feet, encompassing an area of 6 acres, and was inaugurated in 80 AD.

It is much taller than I originally thought and as magnificent as you'd expect. In the early morning there was not much of a wait to get in but it is worth getting a ticket in advance to save queueing.\n\nVisiting in January the area outside and inside did not get too crowded so we were able to enjoy ourselves more and not rush our visit.\n\nYou can see well into the underground without having to go down there from most platforms so we didn't feel the need to.\n\n100% recommend the visit!"}

The audio guide however is not very convenient - you need to download an app on your phone and download there the audio guide which is very scarce and only available in English and Italian.\n\nI would definitely recommend a guided visit in order to understand the place better, or to watch a YouTube video for free with the explanation, as there are tons of them.\n\nThis place has very steep stairs. Please wear comfortable shoes and make sure your knees are in good health - truly each step is 3x normal stairs.\n\nAs most of the place does not have a ceiling and the indoors has no air conditioning, it can get very cold in winder and very warm in summer. I recommend checking the weather and bringing appropriate clothing."}

Be sure to buy your tickets a week in advance and go at least 30-40 minutes before your entry time."}

This iconic amphitheater, with its grand architecture and rich history, leaves you in awe. Walking through its massive arches and viewing the arena evokes a sense of wonder at the gladiator battles and events once held here. The guided tours are informative, shedding light on its construction and cultural significance. However, it can get very crowded, and ticket lines may be long, so planning ahead is essential. A must-see for history lovers!"}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":4,"text":"Stunning place - just incredibly busy! We were there at 11.30am and were having to move as part of the crowd. Also there no information about what you are looking at - so I'd advise getting an audio guide or being part of a tour."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Honorable to visit the colosseum, recommend buying the tickets ahead, or u will have to wait in a 4 hour line, we just easily went and could go straight in. There are three security checkpoints, one under the sunshade outside where they want the tickets ( and passports or ids!) Then one where u need to take all ur stuff and get it checked and scanned ( no knives, i made a mistake by forgetting my swiss army knife in my bag.. the security guard says: \"out or trash!\" dont be a moron like me.. , maybe itis possible to leave and hide ur knife or whatever u cant take there somewhere, and go back in?? I wasnt sure if u could go back in again, so i just said trash) There are multiple bookshops inside, theres a pleasant breeze of air too cools u down a bit. Must see if you are in Rome."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"It's a must go place if you are visiting Rome. It's very huge with architecture.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Amazing place to visit. Make sure you get your tickets ahead of time online otherwise you‚Äôll have to wait in a very long line that would be wasting a lot of time. Wish we could go onto the floor area where the labyrinth was, but it look like he was not available for public access although I did see a few there are on probably a private tour. Amazing to see this wonderful structure and scary to know that almost half 1000,000 people died here."}

This way the flow of visitors would be smoother and not haphazard."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"One and only must see tourist attraction. Recommend to buy the ticket ahead. There is usually a large queue but they organise it well. You will need 1,5-2 hours inside. We chose to visit arena. We would choose again the attic with the view. You will need the ID for the entrance. Maybe the first 1-3 time slot are the best to enter. There are way too many people around afterwards. Enjoy everyone,great historical site."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"I love learning the history of the Colosseum which is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum.

Several movies were filmed here like Roman Holiday, Gladiator, Disney's The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and Godzilla vs. Kong: The New Empire."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"One of the most iconic landmarks in Rome and one of the most famous historical sites in the world. Nothing compares to seeing the Colosseum in person it‚Äôs a powerful feeling to stand in front of such an ancient and massive structure.\n\nYou can truly feel the history come alive here. From gladiator battles to ancient Roman crowds, this place holds so many stories.\n\nI highly recommend visiting during golden hour early morning or before sunset. The lighting is absolutely beautiful for photos, with warm tones and soft shadows that highlight the texture of the stones. It‚Äôs also less crowded and more peaceful.\n\nThis is not just a tourist stop, it‚Äôs a journey into the heart of ancient Rome. A must-see for anyone visiting the city!"}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"I had the opportunity to visit this place with my family, and it was an exceptional experience. Seeing this immense, gigantic, and historic building was truly amazing. I really appreciated all the monuments, the sites, and the ruins. Of course, it is no longer as it was originally, but it still gives an idea of the first structure that was built. It is a place I highly recommend visiting. Just make sure to buy your tickets in advance to avoid the queue, and also keep in mind that it closes at 4:00 PM."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"I visited twice on the same day and I highly suggest a few things:\n\n1) Buy your ticket in advance and go early to avoid waiting in line.\n\n2) Buy a guided tour that includes the underground arena area.  It's only a few euros more but you get a guide, access to off limit areas, and avoid the lines entry.  Absolutely worth the small extra cost.\n\nThe guided tour is only a couple hours and if you want to hang out a bit more, you can easily be out before noon if you book an early entrance.  I would advise a quick lunch at a nearby restaurant and then doing the nearby Roman Forum ruins the same day (should be all included in the same ticket).\n\nIt's really quite impressive inside.  I don't advise just a drive by viewing from the exterior."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"**\n\nSimply wow. The Colosseum is an awe-inspiring masterpiece of ancient architecture and history. Walking through its massive arches, you can almost feel the energy of the past, the roar of the crowds, and the gladiators‚Äô footsteps.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Despite the rain we had a great day here. Once you've explored the colosseum it's off to the Roman Forum and Palentine Hill. The views are spectacular. We spent about 4 hours here, but could easily have spent more time."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"A must see for any visitor of Rome, the Colloseum is definitely an incredible sight to behold!  Tickets are cheap but for the full experiences they sell out fast.  Book well in advance and no backpacks, large purses, or luggage is allowed inside."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Stepping inside is like stepping back two thousand years. The roar of the crowd, the clash of steel, the very air crackles with the echoes of gladiators and emperors. You can almost feel the sand beneath your sandals, the heat of the Roman sun on your face.\n\nI've seen the pictures, read the history books. But nothing, absolutely nothing, prepares you for the sheer scale of this place. It's breathtaking, awe-inspiring, humbling. You crane your neck, trying to take it all in, the tiers upon tiers of seats, the intricate network of underground passages.\nAnd the stories! Every stone whispers tales of courage and cruelty, of triumph and tragedy.\n\nI climbed to the upper levels for panoramic views of the city, I explored the depths of the arena floor, I even imagined myself as a gladiator, ready to face my fate.\n\nIf you're planning a trip to Rome, the Colosseum is a must-see. But don't just rush through it, take your time, let it speak to you. And when you leave, remember this: the heart of a gladiator still beats within those ancient walls.\n\nP.S. Wear comfortable shoes, you'll be doing a lot of walking!"}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":4,"text":"Definitely worth going to see, even if you aren't going inside for a tour. To think this is 1945 years old, almost two millenia, and still standing.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Definitely recommend going here and getting a tour, if you can afford the cost. The skip the line and being told history as you view the location and how it relates to other locations in the area (the Romanforum, gladiator housing ruins, etc) with access to the arena area. We toured with Rutad Romanas, found them on getyourguide, and ours was fantastic!! Andiamo famiglia!!"}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Visiting the Colosseum is an unforgettable experience, but a little planning can make it even better. I recommend heading straight to the arena floor first‚Äîit‚Äôs the highlight of the visit, and exploring it early ensures you don‚Äôt miss out. If you save it for later, you may find yourself stuck exiting before getting the chance to fully enjoy it.\n\nThe gift shop is worth a visit, offering a variety of unique souvenirs and keepsakes that reflect the history of the Colosseum. However, prices are on the higher side, so keep that in mind if you're shopping on a budget.\n\nOverall, the Colosseum is a must-see for history enthusiasts. With a bit of strategy, you can make the most of your visit to this iconic landmark!"}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":4,"text":"Visiting the Colosseum during our layover was definitely an experience‚Äîbusy, packed with people, and a bit overwhelming. If you‚Äôre carrying a suitcase or large bags, I‚Äôd highly recommend leaving them behind. The excitement of being there makes some people less considerate of personal space, and navigating through the crowds with luggage is more hassle than it‚Äôs worth. Comfortable shoes are a must‚Äîno heels! The pebble stone streets can be tricky to walk on, especially in the rain (which we, unfortunately, experienced). Despite the weather and the crowd, I‚Äôd still go back, but next time, definitely without carry-ons or luggage for a smoother experience."}

The Colosseum is famous for a reason and it certainly lives up to its name.\n\nWe arrived to the Colosseum under heavy rain, but that barely affected the experience. It was a well-designed route to pace you around the stalls & arena and there was good signposting throughout the attraction. Information boards around the building put everything into brilliant persepctive.\n\nThere is no shortage of photos of the Colosseum online, but being there is different. Especially for people interested in the history of the gladiators and the daily life of the Roman Empire, this is a top place to be.\n\nWe did not purchase the \"Full Experience\" ticket which allows you to walk on the arena floor (and a bunch of other perks); but even then I still feel that the ticket, which also includes the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill, is extremely worth it.\n\nTransport was convenient via Metro and bus.\n\nStaff was friendly and experience was smooth.

It is impossible to understand how to book guides for the underground tour, which has 25 slots per 30 mins. It seems that very often people buy the ticket for it but can‚Äôt book the guide, so they turn up at the designated time but are turned away despite having a slot held for them.

So I ended up buying just arena ticket. This got us into just the arena, which is what I decided on.  I figure that it would be best to see the 360¬∞ view of the arena from the stage where the gladiators must have further battles.  If I could have, I would‚Äôve also liked to buy a separate tickets to see the top floor and the basement.\n\nSo make sure that you check out the different types of tickets and pick out exactly where you want to visit    There were people who came and tried to visit the Colosseum without tickets and were turned around by the staff.\n\nOur arena ticket also included the visit to the Palatine Hills, which was so beautiful.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":4,"text":"The Colosseum in Rome is an enduring symbol of human achievement, earning its place as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World through a worldwide vote. With its origins as the Flavian Amphitheatre, this ancient wonder was the largest amphitheater of its time.\n\nOne of my architectural study tours has led to a fascinating find a fresh perspective on the Colosseum's enduring architectural legacy.\n\nü•∞It remained in use for over 500 years, with the last recorded games held in the 6th century.\n\nAt the epicenter of ancient Rome, the Colosseum emerged as a powerful symbol of human potential, highlighting the remarkable achievements that can be realized through passion, innovation, and collective endeavor. The Construction began around 70-72 AD under Emperor Vespasian and was completed in 80 AD under his successor Titus.¬†The structure‚Äôs materials include travertine limestone, tuff, brick-faced concrete, and marble. This iconic landmark became the largest structure of its kind, a lasting tribute to the creative genius and engineering prowess of the ancient Romans. Spanning 620 feet by 513 feet, the Colosseum rose 160 feet into the sky, its four stories of arches, columns, and windows a timeless testament to human achievement.\n\nThis magnificent architectural wonder featured three grand exterior levels, each showcasing 80 elegant arches, welcoming as many as 50,000 spectators who entered through 76 numbered gates, representing the boundless potential that awaited them. The remaining entrances were reserved for those who exemplified excellence‚Äîtwo for the emperor, and two for the fearless gladiators who would soon face their challenges with bravery and resilience within the arena.\n\nUpon entering, visitors ascended sloping ramps, guided to their seats by a thoughtful layout that acknowledged the rich tapestry of society‚Äîdivided by gender and class, yet woven together by a shared sense of curiosity. Women and the poor found their place on wooden benches in the uppermost tier. A massive, billowing awning‚Äîthe velarium‚Äîcould be stretched above, shielding the crowd from the searing sun.\nUnder the arena floor, concealed chambers (hypogeum) waited, holding warriors and beasts on the cusp of emerging, exemplifying the incredible possibilities that arose from human creativity and perseverance. The Colosseum's formative years featured an extraordinary feat of engineering, hosting dazzling reenactments of naval battles that epitomized Roman creativity. As the Romans reflected on their accomplishments, they recognized the value of a solid foundation in sustaining their vision for generations to come.\n\nImagine:  From dawn till dusk, the Colosseum teemed with vitality and excitement. Mornings echoed with lively laughter and wonder during comedic competitions and exotic animal showcases. As the day wore on, suspenseful silence was broken by explosive cheers and gasps of amazement during the legendary gladiator battles‚Äîthrilling testaments to human courage, and the will to thrive. The movie Gladiator left an indelible mark on me, and its theme song, 'Now We Are Free', still resonates deeply. The film's poignant portrayal of the colosseum's grandeur transports me back to my own visit, where I was captivated by the ancient architecture and briefly lost in the throngs of people. Thankfully, my tour guide rescued me from my momentary disorientation."}

To get inside, we stood in a long line that moved fairly quickly to obtain tickets. You need a photo ID, and you have to wait for the time printed on the ticket before going in. Once inside, expect to climb a lot stairs, I believe there's a lift, but I'm not certain. There's a little museum on the second floor that displayed artifacts and explanations of how the animals emerged from the ground during contests. The rest of the floors are pretty much the same thing, just a higher view of the arena.  The last floor has a souvenir shop with cool colosseum items, but it's a little pricey.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"The ruins are impressive, but it's always crowded. Arm yourself with patience and you'll get trough it. Booking a guided tour might be the way to go with the Colosseum. We booked a tour without a guide, just an audio guide in the app, but that app drains the battery of your phone. It uses geolocation and proximity (Bluetooth) to other phone to pinpoint your location within the Colosseum so it knows what part of the audio guide to play. Whilst that's a pretty cool feature, combined with the thousands of people visiting and using their smartphones in the area, leads to an empty phone battery real fast. If you plan on skipping the guided tour, plan on packing an external battery for your phone. I forgot mine home, and my phone dropped from 80% battery to 40% battery in 15 minutes (whilst using the audio guide app). Needles to say, I didn't use the audio guide after the first 15 minutes."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Colosseum Review\n\nVisiting the Colosseum is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It‚Äôs a magnificent and iconic historical site that absolutely lives up to its reputation, but there are definitely a few things to keep in mind. The place can be very overcrowded, especially during peak seasons, so it‚Äôs important to plan ahead. I highly recommend purchasing tickets or booking a tour at least a month in advance‚Äîotherwise, you may struggle to get in at all.\n\nThe experience itself is incredible but can be physically demanding. Be prepared to walk a lot, climb stairs, and spend a good amount of time on your feet. My tour lasted about two hours, and by the end of it, I was completely exhausted. That said, the effort is worth it. Walking through the ruins, you get to witness the scale and history of what was once the heart of Roman entertainment, imagining the ancient crowds and gladiatorial battles.\n\nDespite the crowds and fatigue, I‚Äôm so glad I went. Seeing the Colosseum up close is unforgettable, and it‚Äôs truly a must-see for anyone visiting Rome.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Visiting the Colosseum in December as a history enthusiast was an incredibly enriching experience, far beyond just seeing a famous monument. The cooler temperatures of the season made for a comfortable visit, and the crowds were much thinner compared to the peak summer months, allowing me to fully appreciate the majesty of this ancient amphitheater without the usual bustle.\n\nThe Colosseum‚Äôs sheer scale and historical significance are impossible to ignore. As I stood before its towering exterior, I couldn‚Äôt help but imagine the gladiatorial battles and public spectacles that once took place in this vast arena, where up to 50,000 spectators could gather. Walking through the entrance, the weight of its 2,000-year history hit me‚Äîthis was the heart of Roman entertainment, politics, and social life.\n\nInside, the intricate details of the structure became even more apparent. I was particularly fascinated by the underground areas‚Äîthe ‚Äúhypogeum‚Äù‚Äîwhere gladiators and animals were kept before their dramatic entrances into the arena. The ruins of the once lavishly decorated floors, now exposed, gave a glimpse of the technical marvels that supported the shows, such as elevators and trapdoors. The audio guides provided fascinating historical context, explaining the Colosseum‚Äôs various phases, from its construction under Emperor Vespasian in AD 72 to its eventual decline and repurposing over the centuries.\n\nThe upper levels of the Colosseum offered stunning views of the Roman Forum and the Palatine Hill, which were just as captivating as the amphitheater itself. It was easy to picture the grandeur of ancient Rome from this vantage point. The cool December air made the experience even more enjoyable, as I had the space and time to reflect on the deep history of the site without being rushed.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments was walking around the outer walls, where you could see the marks of time‚Äîparts of the Colosseum that were damaged by earthquakes and the plundering of its stones for other construction projects. These scars added a layer of realism to the visit, reminding me that the Colosseum was both a symbol of Roman power and a testament to the fragility of all things, even the mightiest structures.\n\nIn December, the Colosseum was quieter, allowing for an immersive experience. I could almost hear the echoes of ancient voices, gladiators preparing for combat, and the roar of a thousand spectators. If you‚Äôre a history enthusiast, visiting the Colosseum in winter not only offers a more relaxed pace but also an opportunity to deeply connect with the past, away from the distractions of peak-season tourism.\n\nFor anyone who appreciates history, the Colosseum is a must-see, and December‚Äôs serene atmosphere gives you the chance to absorb its full grandeur and historical significance."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"The Colosseum in Rome stands as a testament to ancient Roman engineering and architectural brilliance. Its well-preserved structure showcases the advanced techniques of its time, with intricate arches and vast underground chambers that once held gladiators and animals. The sheer scale and durability of the Colosseum are awe-inspiring, reflecting the Romans' expertise in construction.\n\nHowever, amidst the architectural marvel, the Colosseum also bears witness to a much darker aspect of history. The brutal gladiatorial contests, where people fought to the death for public entertainment, are a stark reminder of the cruelty that once took place within its walls. It's a place that evokes a mix of admiration for its engineering and somber reflection on the human cost of its bloody spectacles."}

The place is colossal , you can enter up to second floor, there is lift but only for peole who have problems with mobility. I was socked by the size of it all , from the inside , it looks much bigger than from the outside. If you are solo visitor , you will need maybe an hour to see everything.

If you have any problems.. they are EXTREMELY helpful and are completely set apart from other places. During the summer months, they have a team of doctor and nurses.  Over winter... they will assist you with ambulances should you need anything like that as unfortunatly we did.  Couple of points...\n\n1) make sure you were VERY sturdy shoes\n2) take water and/or shade in summer months\n3) book tickets via their own website.  Anywhere else like got your guide or aviator are 3rd party and VERY highly inflated!!!\n4) make sure you use all handrails and watch your step!!\n5) get there on time and make sure you take your passport!!!!\n6) There are quite steep stairs throughout and alot of walking.\n\nENJOY!!"}

Some great views on the second floor, but so many people waiting for photos you can't really take a moment to try imagine what it was like thousands of years ago. The majority of it you just walk around the second tier, so it's just the same view from different angles.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but I was expecting a less chaotic and more organised tour as you have to reserve an hour. There's barely anything to see, the majority of the place is cordoned off. I know it's old and probably a safety thing but it was disappointing. I expected more of an \"experience\" as you get with sites in other cities where it's more immersive with videos of how historians imagined the place and gladiator fights. There was some information about old bits of statues and rocks, but no real information around the coliseum to know what you were looking at."}

Throngs of people at all times and very advisable to pre-purchase your tickets. The underground tickets are near impossible to obtain from the official website but going down to the arena is definitely worth paying extra for too. Tickets must match the holder name so make sure you have ID papers to show (take a photo of your passport and show on phone is also acceptable).

It was made of wood and covered with a layer of sand to absorb the blood that was shed by the gladiators, animals, and criminals. But later it was reconstructed after end of Gladiators battles for giving visitors a better idea of what the Colosseum must have looked like.\n\nSecond Floor - gives the view of first floor and place from where the action was seen.\n\nBest way to visit Colosseum - Guided tour, it may be bit costly but guide shares the all insightful information about this place, which will help us to understand how Romans used Colosseum."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"So your in Rome. How bad can it be. The Colosseum is iconic and a must see landmark while in Rome. It gets very busy but has a ton space around it so it is very doable. If you are wanting to go inside, I highly recommend a guided tour, otherwise it is just a bunch of old bricks. To bring those bricks to life and understand how incredible this building was requires some additional instruction from a professional. My recommendation is either take the time for a tour or take some great photos from outside and move on to the forum. If you are looking to do a walking tour of Rome, I recommend putting this near the end so you can get the amazing evening lighting that they hand on the Colosseum at night. Also, if you are coming out of the subway station, go to your left about 30 yards and take the stairway up to the area that is elevated lining directly over the Colosseum. You won‚Äôt regret the view."}

The underground floors from where humans and animals where used get elevated from nowhere can be seen clearly. The place withstands many earthquakes and fire incidents, still stands tall as a symbol of Roman culture and architecture. To visit inside the colossium, you can take the local train which stops right in front of this place and you can take a ticket which costs 18 euros. I visited during November so line was not too big.

With the prepurchased ticket you have a 20-Minute Window to enter around your time slot (10min before, 10min after). They will not let you in earlier and might decline entry after the 10 minutes. However, by this method there is almost no waiting, even on a Sunday. I highly recommend getting a guide for the tour as you will miss out A LOT of information without it.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Let me tell you something: if you‚Äôre ever in Rome and don‚Äôt visit the Colosseum, did you even Rome? This place is basically the OG stadium ‚Äî think NFL meets Game of Thrones but with more togas and fewer commercials. I walked in and immediately felt like Maximus from Gladiator (minus the sword, chiseled abs, and tragic backstory).\n\nThe structure is massive. Like‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHow did they build this 2,000 years ago without a Home Depot?‚Äù kind of massive. Every stone screams ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt have machines but we had ambition.‚Äù You look at this place and suddenly your IKEA bookshelf feels like a participation trophy.\n\nThey say it held up to 80,000 people back in the day. That‚Äôs nearly a full Yankee Stadium, but with lions instead of overpriced hot dogs. Speaking of which ‚Äî no lions anymore, but there are a lot of tour guides aggressively offering ‚Äúskip the line‚Äù deals like ancient Roman merchants hustling you in broken English. Respect the hustle.\n\nI went on a hot day, so I felt a little like a gladiator myself ‚Äî sweaty, confused, and unsure how I got there. Pro tip: bring water, wear comfy shoes, and prepare for an existential crisis about what your ancestors were doing while these people were engineering marvels of architecture and casually throwing epic death matches for entertainment.\n\nInside, it‚Äôs mostly ruins now ‚Äî but majestic ruins. You get to walk through the skeleton of an empire. The underground tunnels are wild ‚Äî that‚Äôs where they kept the animals and gladiators before they were dramatically yeeted into the arena. It‚Äôs creepy and cool at the same time. Like ancient Airbnb for tigers and warriors.\n\nThere‚Äôs a small museum inside with relics, armor, and some 3D models that help you imagine what it used to look like. Honestly, I wish modern stadiums had the same vibe ‚Äî fewer nachos, more columns.\n\nIn short: 10/10 historical drama. If you squint hard enough, you can still hear the crowd chant ‚ÄúHail Caesar‚Äù and maybe a confused tourist yelling ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the bathroom?‚Äù\n\nWould I go again? Yes. Would I fight a lion there for the ‚ÄòGram? ‚Ä¶That‚Äôs between me and Caesar."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Ah, the Colosseum. The grandest arena ever built by the hands of men. A place where warriors are forged, legends are born, and the sands drink deeply of blood. To stand before it is to feel the weight of Rome's glory pressing upon your chest. It is not just a structure‚Äîit is the beating heart of the Empire, a temple to violence and spectacle.\n\nFrom the outside, it looms like a mighty beast of stone, defying the ages. Its arches soar to the heavens, a testament to Roman engineering and ambition. Step within, and the roar of the crowd echoes still, faint but unmistakable, like the ghosts of those who fought and fell there calling out to you.\n\nThe arena floor may now be silent, but look closely, and you can almost see the battles unfold. The clash of steel, the cries of men, the roars of beasts‚Äîit was all here, right before the eyes of thousands, their cheers a deafening wave. This is where men like Maximus proved their mettle, where the gods of the arena were worshiped.\n\nBut the glory is not without its shadows. The blood that soaked these sands came at a cost‚Äîa cost paid by slaves, gladiators, and beasts torn from their lands. The Colosseum is not merely a monument to Rome's greatness"}

The planning and execution of this structure boggles the mind for its time. Pictures just don't do it justice. You need to come and experience it person and see how large and detailed it is.

Completed in 80 AD during the reign of Emperor Titus, this massive amphitheater could hold around 50,000 to 80,000 spectators. It was primarily used for gladiatorial contests, animal hunts, and public spectacles, such as mock sea battles and executions.\n\nThe Colosseum features a unique architectural design with a series of arches and columns in the Roman style. Its oval shape allows for great sightlines, making it an impressive venue for viewing events. The outer walls were originally adorned with marble, but much of it was removed over the centuries for other building projects.\n\nToday, the Colosseum stands as a breathtaking ruin that attracts millions of visitors each year. It's not only a testament to Roman engineering and architecture but also a reminder of the history and culture of ancient Rome. Visitors can explore its underground chambers, where gladiators and animals awaited their turn in the arena, and learn about the events that took place within its grand walls. It‚Äôs a UNESCO World Heritage site and a must-see for anyone visiting the Eternal City!"}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Anfiteatro Flavio), is one of the most iconic landmarks of ancient Rome and a symbol of the grandeur of the Roman Empire. Located in the center of Rome, it was constructed between 70 AD and 80 AD under the emperors Vespasian and Titus, with modifications made by Domitian, the later emperor of the Flavian dynasty.\n\nKey Features:\n‚Ä¢\tSize: The Colosseum is an immense structure, measuring approximately 189 meters (615 feet) in length, 156 meters (512 feet) in width, and standing about 50 meters (164 feet) tall. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators.\n‚Ä¢\tArchitecture:\n‚Ä¢\tIt is an elliptical amphitheater, with four stories of arches, columns, and decorative elements. The first three levels have Corinthian, Ionic, and Doric columns, while the upper level is adorned with pilasters.\n‚Ä¢\tThe arena floor was originally made of wood and covered with sand (which gave it the name ‚Äúarena‚Äù from the Latin word for sand, ‚Äúharena‚Äù). The amphitheater was equipped with elaborate systems to allow for quick changes of scenery and the staging of different types of events.\n‚Ä¢\tHypogeum: Beneath the arena floor was the hypogeum, a complex network of tunnels and rooms that housed animals, gladiators, and stage equipment. This area could be accessed by lifts and trapdoors, enabling dramatic entrances for both performers and animals.\n\nPurpose:\n‚Ä¢\tGladiatorial Games: The Colosseum was primarily used for gladiatorial contests, where trained fighters (often slaves or prisoners of war) fought to the death for the entertainment of the public. Other events, such as animal hunts, mock naval battles, and executions, were also staged here.\n‚Ä¢\tPublic Spectacles: It served as a venue for large-scale public entertainments that were part of the bread and circuses (panem et circenses) policy to keep the Roman population entertained and distracted.\n\nHistorical Significance:\n‚Ä¢\tConstruction: The Colosseum was built on the site of an artificial lake created by Emperor Nero in his Domus Aurea (Golden House). It was a gift to the Roman people, reflecting the Flavian emperors‚Äô desire to return public spaces to the citizens of Rome.\n‚Ä¢\tSymbol of Power: The Colosseum was not just a place for entertainment but also a powerful symbol of imperial Rome‚Äôs might, engineering prowess, and control over both people and nature.\n\nModern Day:\n‚Ä¢\tTourist Attraction: Today, the Colosseum is one of the most visited landmarks in the world, attracting millions of tourists annually. It remains a symbol of ancient Roman engineering and the enduring legacy of the empire.\n‚Ä¢\tUNESCO World Heritage Site: The Colosseum is part of the Historic Centre of Rome, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nDespite suffering damage from earthquakes, looting, and the passage of time, the Colosseum remains one of the most remarkable ancient structures in the world, representing both the grandeur and the darker aspects of Roman civilization."}

Despite the horrible things that happened in the Colloseoum in the time of its glory this remains  standing proof of the greatness of the Roman Empire even after so long. The Italian people have done an amazing job preseving evidence of their past and they deserve full administration for their efforts!\n\nThe place can be very busy even though we visited on a weekday. The surroundings are beautiful especially with the Roman Forum right next to it and a few near by restaurant up on the hill immediately next to the Colloseoum.\n\nBeautiful experience in itself just having a nice pizza and watching it."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Certainly! Here‚Äôs my take on the Colosseum:\n\nVisiting the Colosseum feels like stepping back in time to the heart of ancient Rome. Seeing it in person, it's astounding to imagine that this massive amphitheater was built nearly 2,000 years ago. Its scale is jaw-dropping, and it's clear why this structure has fascinated people for centuries. Even with portions of it worn by time, its size and architecture are still incredibly impressive. Walking through, you can almost hear the echoes of the roaring crowds and envision the dramatic spectacles that once took place.\n\nOne of the most captivating parts of the Colosseum is the underground area, the hypogeum, where animals and gladiators were held before entering the arena. Exploring this section adds a layer of mystery and intensity, making it easy to imagine the tension before a fight.\n\nHowever, it can get quite crowded, especially during peak hours. The best way to enjoy it is by booking tickets ahead of time or going with a guided tour, which provides fascinating insights into the Colosseum's history and architecture. Overall, visiting the Colosseum is unforgettable. It‚Äôs more than just a tourist attraction; it‚Äôs a powerful reminder of the marvels of ancient Roman engineering and a humbling look into history."}

This monument is equally enticing with its looks as it is with its history. I would recommend buying the full access arena ticket so that you take a relaxed view of the underground as well as the seating section as the gladiators would have had. It also gives a better chance to shoot videos and photos. I would not recommend the attic ticket since it has the worst view of the arena in olden times, why would you wanna do that now. Be there as early as possible. Most preferably the first or second slot because the lines will be long even if you come for the first slot since the place is huge and every slot has a lot of people accommodated."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"It's historically a great place, and it's a must-visit place if you come to Rome.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"The grandeur of the Colosseum greets visitors with an overwhelming sense of ancient magnificence. Standing before its weathered travertine walls, the sheer scale of this architectural marvel immediately captures the imagination. The massive stone arches rise tier upon tier, creating dramatic shadows that shift with the movement of the sun across the Roman sky.\n\nApproaching the entrance, the atmosphere buzzes with a mix of excitement and anticipation. The security checkpoints, while necessary, can create significant bottlenecks during peak hours. The queue system winds around the exterior, exposing visitors to Rome's weather elements - particularly challenging during summer months when the sun beats down on the exposed waiting area.\n\nInside the amphitheater, worn stone steps lead visitors through centuries of history. The passages bear countless marks of time, with smooth depressions in the stone steps testament to millions of footsteps over two millennia. The stone walls hold a peculiar coolness even on warm days, and running your hand along them connects you directly to the ancient craftsmen who shaped these blocks.\n\nThe main arena level provides the most dramatic views. Looking up, the layered rings of seating create a dizzying perspective that demonstrates the remarkable engineering achievements of ancient Rome. The partial reconstruction of the wooden arena floor offers insight into the original layout, though some may find it detracts from the archaeological authenticity.\n\nUnderground chambers, once hidden beneath the arena floor, now lie exposed to the elements. These hypogeum passages tell silent stories of gladiators and wild beasts waiting in the darkness. The complex network of corridors and mechanical rooms reveals sophisticated engineering that enabled spectacular entertainments for the ancient audience.\n\nThe upper levels, when accessible, reward visitors with breathtaking views across the Roman Forum and surrounding archaeological park. These vantage points offer excellent photo opportunities, though the protective barriers, while necessary for safety, can interfere with capturing the perfect shot.\n\nSound carries remarkably well throughout the structure, an reminder of the acoustic engineering that allowed tens of thousands of spectators to hear the events below. Even today, whispers from distant corners sometimes float unexpectedly to other areas, creating an almost ethereal atmosphere.\n\nThe restoration work presents both benefits and drawbacks. While essential for preservation, scaffolding and construction equipment can significantly impact the visitor experience. Some sections remain perpetually under renovation, limiting access to certain areas and affecting the visual continuity of the monument.\n\nInformation panels provide historical context, though their placement sometimes creates congestion in narrow passages as visitors pause to read. The multimedia guides offer more detailed information but can distract from the immediate experience of the space.\n\nWeather plays a crucial role in the visit quality. Rain makes the ancient stones treacherously slippery, while strong sun can create uncomfortable conditions in exposed areas. The lack of shade in many sections means visitors should carefully consider timing their visit to avoid peak sun hours.\n\nThe engineering details become more apparent upon closer inspection. The precision of stone cutting, the intelligent use of arches for load distribution, and the sophisticated drainage systems all speak to the advanced capabilities of Roman builders. Some original architectural elements remain visible, offering glimpses into construction techniques that have influenced buildings for two millennia.\n\nCrowd management varies throughout the day. Early morning visitors often enjoy more peaceful exploration, while midday brings waves of tour groups that can overwhelm the narrower passages. The echo of multiple tour guides speaking in various languages can create a cacophony that detracts from the historical atmosphere.\n\nConservation efforts ar"}

Lifts and elevators were under the floor and operated by slaves could bring anything from wild beasts to humans up to the arena floor.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Visiting the Colosseum is an unforgettable experience that transports you back to ancient Rome. As one of the world's most iconic landmarks, it stands as a testament to Roman engineering and architectural prowess. The sheer size of the Colosseum is awe-inspiring, and it's hard not to be amazed by its history as a center for gladiatorial combat and public spectacles.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Historical Significance: The Colosseum offers an immersive glimpse into the past, with informative displays that educate visitors on its construction, purpose, and the events that took place here. It‚Äôs an incredible way to learn about ancient Roman culture and entertainment.\n\n2.

Knowledgeable guides bring the ancient stories to life, making the visit more engaging.\n\n4.

Ticket Prices: While the Colosseum is a must-see, the entry fees can be a bit high compared to other attractions in Rome. However, considering the historical value and the experience, it‚Äôs worth the cost.\n\n3. Limited Access to Certain Areas: Some areas, like the arena floor or the upper tiers, are not included with standard admission, and you may need a special tour to access them.\n\nTips for Visiting:\n\nBook Tickets in Advance: The lines can be long, especially during the summer months, so pre-purchasing tickets or a skip-the-line pass can save a lot of time.\n\nWear Comfortable Shoes: The site involves walking on uneven surfaces, so comfortable, sturdy shoes are a must.\n\nCombine with Other Ancient Sites: The Colosseum is part of the larger Roman Forum and Palatine Hill archaeological area. Purchasing a combined ticket is a great way to explore these neighboring historic sites.\n\nOverall, the Colosseum is an absolute must-visit if you're in Rome. Whether you're a history buff or simply enjoy exploring ancient monuments, it offers a unique window into the grandeur and drama of ancient Roman life."}

Despite the centuries of wear, the Colosseum‚Äôs architecture remains impressive‚Äîespecially when you consider that it was built nearly 2,000 years ago. The detailed stonework and the remnants of the arena give you a real sense of the engineering marvels of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe tour I took was well-organized, providing fascinating insights into the history and purpose of the Colosseum. From the logistics of hosting massive events to the construction techniques, the information added a deeper layer to my appreciation of the site. Standing in the arena area and looking up at the towering walls was surreal; I could almost hear the echoes of the past.\n\nOne of the highlights of my visit was walking through the underground tunnels where gladiators and wild animals once awaited their turn in the arena. This part of the tour gave me a glimpse of the Colosseum's hidden workings, offering a different perspective on the structure.\n\nWhile the Colosseum can be crowded with tourists, the experience was still incredible, and the lines were worth the wait. I‚Äôd recommend going early in the day or late in the afternoon to avoid peak crowds. The panoramic views from the upper levels of the Colosseum, overlooking the Roman Forum and surrounding city, are breathtaking and offer a perfect end to the visit.\n\nOverall, my visit to the Colosseum was an unforgettable journey into ancient Rome.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Visiting the Colosseum was a highlight of our trip to Rome, especially with the Arena Full Experience tickets we booked. The entire experience felt well-organized from start to finish. We were able to explore not only the Colosseum itself but also the nearby Palatine Hill and Roman Forum with this same ticket‚Äîa fantastic added value!\n\nFor anyone planning to visit, it‚Äôs worth noting that there are specialized tickets if you‚Äôre interested in seeing the Atrium or the Underground, which weren‚Äôt part of our visit. Similarly, if a guided tour is on your list, remember to select tickets that include this, as our self-guided experience allowed us to roam freely but might not satisfy those looking for historical details. We noticed that if you're an avid history lover, using an audio guide, such as those from Rick Steves Audio Europe, can be a great way to gain insights at your own pace.\n\nThough we booked our tickets a week ahead, purchasing at least a month in advance is generally recommended, especially through the Colosseum's official site, Tripadvisor or GetYourGuide to avoid scams. Since it wasn‚Äôt overly crowded, we didn‚Äôt need the skip-the-line option, but this might be helpful for peak times. For budget travelers, it‚Äôs good to remember that entry is free on the first Sunday of each month, though crowds are likely heavier on those days.\n\nSecurity was smooth and efficient, like airport checks. Without a guide, we had all the time we wanted for photos and to absorb the atmosphere of this ancient marvel. A souvenir shop inside offers a range of memorabilia for anyone looking to take a piece of Rome back home.\n\nSeeing one of the wonders of the world in person was beyond words‚Äîstanding in the arena where history was made so long ago felt surreal and deeply moving. Highly recommend adding the Colosseum to your bucket list for anyone visiting Rome; it‚Äôs truly worth experiencing at least once in your life!\n\nP.S.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":3,"text":"This is obviously a feature of Rome. Not exactly my thing, but if you love looking at the old artifacts this is definitely a way to go. We went in the downstairs portion as well. We did that as part of a package. And getting to go down was actually really interesting to get to see where the gladiators came in, and there was a multimedia film that they presented as well. We had a wheelchair with us. We were able to go and do almost all of the basement. We just had to a back track to go back up the elevator. The others walked upstairs. And then they had the elevator to go up to the other levels. It is actually quite accessible. Be cautious with time. We went on one of the last parts of the day which was 3:00. It was not enough time. They say that the location closes at 4:30, but we found what that means to the Romans is they are going home at closing time. So you will be kicked out earlier. They actually walk you along. They have security and workers that push you along that you cannot stop. You cannot turn back. You will keep going to an exit. We were all cleared out by 4:15. We had even stopped at 4:00 to try and use the restroom and they had already closed all of the restrooms. So use those well before closing.  There was nobody left inside by the time we were out. We found that at many of those locations that they do that. So just be aware. Give yourself extra time in the day because they're closing time is not legit. We went in November so maybe they have a later closing time during summer. I don't know. But that was really frustrating that you pay to go in and you don't get to see everything. You don't get a stop and read. You don't get a look at stuff you got to walk out. Enjoyed our downstairs but are upstairs. Was nothing because they booted us out."}

The crowds are difficult and stressful, although tourists try to be polite with each other. The views are glorious. The architecture is endlessly impressive.

Other than the arena view point, on the way to the exit, you have even better views of the underground floor.\n\nThere are two things that I didn't like, first , it is very disorganized at the entrance. I bought 8:30 entrance tickets, and arrive at 8:10, there are already a long line. But people who have tickets at 8:15. 8:30, 8:45 and 9:00 are all in the same line. They didn't have people line up in different lane based on the time. The door opens at 8:30, and the line started moving around 8:40. I saw people in front of us didn't get in because their ticket is at 9:00.\n\nSecond , it is very difficult to get the full experience ticket. I guess that is an Italy thing, they make it very difficult to buy tickets on official website or authorized third party. And you have to pay triple or even 5 times price to get full experience ticket through tour agency."}

There is so much grand architecture to appreciate from the towering arch columns to the intricate underground passages.

The architects who designed it were thinking beyond their time, with elevators, retractable roofs, constant fresh water supply from outside sources, seating numbers and sections. Just the organization alone for the amount of people it could hold is mind blowing. This is probably the closest an ancient civilization has ever came to what we have today but with aesthetic appeal, art and statues well beyond what we would include in our structures today.

Towering over the city, the Colosseum is a breathtaking testament to the grandeur and ambition of ancient Roman engineering. Built nearly 2,000 years ago, it still stands as a symbol of human ingenuity, endurance, and creativity.\n\nWalking through its arches feels like stepping into history. You can almost hear the roar of 50,000 spectators and envision the dramatic spectacles that once captivated the Roman Empire. From gladiator battles to theatrical performances, this arena was a place of both brutality and brilliance. The architecture itself is astonishing‚Äînot just in size, but in its complex system of corridors, trapdoors, and underground chambers. It‚Äôs a true marvel of design.\n\nWhat makes the Colosseum even more inspiring is how it has survived the test of time, wars, earthquakes, and centuries of change. It tells a story not just of entertainment, but of a civilization‚Äôs rise, legacy, and enduring influence on the world.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre a history enthusiast, an architecture lover, or simply a curious traveler, the Roman Colosseum is a must-see.

We went in winter to avoid the busy crowds and had a blast.\n\nTime: We went at 9:30am and waited only 5minutes to get our tickets.\n\nPrice: Tickets to enter was $15-20 EUR and then we paid an additional $10-15EUR to do the underground passage.\n\nDuration of stay:  2-3 hours total. If you have 1 hour I HIGHLY recommend you do the underground tour. There is so much history to explore and you really gain an appreciation of this Wonder when you are below ground. Plus you can gain access to an exclusive look out over the Arena which is special. Add this to the bucket this of places to visit!"}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"The Colosseum is truly a wonder. We have seen plenty of promoters on here telling everyone they have to have a guide. We bought our own tickets (and not off the street), walked in and had an awesome experience. Guide not needed. Underground tickets are hard to come by without spending those extra euro. None-the-less, it's possible. There are wonderful exhibits to explore inside which have English translations posted on them, so you're not missing out on anything there. As for the history, you will get plenty of it while you're there and overhearing the guides there the day we went, there were no great epiphanies of information. The colosseum itself is packed with people, so we recommend buying your tickets early before you go. If you have a ticket beforehand, you can pretty much just walk right in on most days. Be aware, that the scammers will be out in the area of the colosseum, so remember to have valuables close, be aware of your surroundings, and don't let anyone put anything on your hand or wrist. If they say it's free, it's not. If they tell you they have change, they won't give it to you. Just don't buy anything unless it's from an actual store, or in the colosseum shop which you will have to walk right by or through to exit once inside. It's a pleasant experience and you will also find the forum nearby. So, break out those cameras and visit an iconic landmark."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":4,"text":"What a breathtaking piece of architecture ! Loved spending time here and getting to know a little history of the gladiators.\n\nThe downsides and tips:\n\n1. Honestly, there are way too many tours and travel agencies that offer you great deals online; however make sure if you book online and you have to meet up to get physical tickets resch at least 35 mins before because you won't be able to find them at all. If you've missed your tour, there are tourist info officers who would introduce you to some agents that are legit to get you done with a guided tour. Trust me , guided tour though, not worth it. The speaking lasted roughly about 15 minutes with the only advantage being that we could skip the line and had access to the arena.\n\nSide note : Multiple entries to colosseum and it looks like different sections of the colosseum are separated out for the tour agencies."}

Walk around and use the subway as a means of transport. And be sure to do the Palatine and the Roman Forum. I‚Äôve been there twice and it‚Äôs worth every penny. The sunset here is beautiful."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Visiting the Colosseum was a profound journey through both ancient history and architectural magnificence. This colossal amphitheater stands as a testament to the ingenuity and engineering prowess of ancient Rome, and it's a must-see for anyone with a passion for history and culture.\n\nWalking through the arches of the Colosseum, I was immediately struck by its sheer size and grandeur. It's hard to fathom that such a monumental structure was built almost 2,000 years ago, yet it still stands strong, preserving the stories of gladiators, emperors, and the roaring crowds that once filled its tiers.\n\nThe intricate network of corridors and chambers beneath the arena offered a glimpse into the backstage of ancient spectacles. Imagining the bustling activity of gladiators preparing for combat and wild animals being readied for the arena added a layer of realism to the experience.\n\nThe Colosseum's elliptical shape and tiered seating were ingeniously designed to accommodate up to 50,000 spectators, creating an immersive atmosphere for the games and events that unfolded within its walls. Standing on the arena floor, I could almost hear the echoes of cheers and the clash of swords, transported back in time to the era of Roman glory.\n\nThe ongoing preservation efforts and informative exhibits provided valuable insights into the history and significance of this iconic landmark. Learning about the technological innovations and cultural influences that shaped the Colosseum reinforced its status as a marvel of ancient architecture.\n\nI recommend visiting the Colosseum both during the day and at night. During the day, the sunlight illuminates its weathered stone facade, while at night, the subtle lighting casts an enchanting glow, enhancing its timeless allure.\n\nIn conclusion, the Colosseum is more than just a monument; it's a living testament to the resilience and creativity of ancient Rome. Whether you're a history enthusiast, an architecture buff, or simply a traveler seeking inspiration, the Colosseum offers an unforgettable experience that transcends time and leaves a lasting impression.\n\n---\n\nThis review captures the awe-inspiring nature of the Colosseum, blending historical context with personal experience and emphasizing its cultural significance as a symbol of Roman engineering and entertainment prowess."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":3,"text":"The restoration and landscaping of the Colosseum have been done very well. It manages to shine from the moment you see it until the last glance you take as you leave. I recommend buying tickets online due to the crowds. Be sure to pay attention to the timing when selecting your online tickets and be there at the specified time, or else you won't be able to enter.\n\nThe organization of the entrance area was very poor. Unfortunately, I find the ticket prices to be quite expensive, and I don't think the regular ticket meets expectations. We bought tickets that also provided access to the Arena, Underground, and III Level of the Colosseum with a guide. It was really expensive, and although we were generally satisfied with our visit, I don't think it was worth the money we spent.\n\nAdditionally, when the tour started, the guide recommended installing an app on our phones. The guide's explanations and more were available on this app, allowing us to get more detailed information. Okay, it's nice to get information, but the problem is they charge so much money and don't even provide a printed, quality brochure!"}

If you really want to visit the underground or 'attic' then you must buy them online. I believe they sell out quick, so you must buy them the day they come out. I think the tix were cheaper in person. The line to buy tickets is all in the sun, so bring a hat or water If hot.

We went into the ticket line, which we were in for about 5 minutes, and got our tickets which had a entry time that was for 10 minutes after we bought it. We got in smoothly, spent as much time as we wanted exploring, and got some nice souvenirs towards the exit. I would recommend getting tickets ahead of time. It gives you a reserved entry time, and if you try to enter before that time you‚Äôre not allowed. This helps in breaking up long lines, I appreciated the organization.

Even after informing the customer service team seconds after receiving the confirmation and providing proof of the issue, they were unhelpful and incompetent. They refused to correct the time despite availability, and each agent seemed less concerned about customer satisfaction than the last.\n\nCertainly, you do not honor the discipline, organization, practicality, and sense of duty of your ancient Roman ancestors.\n\nAdditionally, when we arrived, there were some construction works ongoing, which we weren‚Äôt warned about in advance.

In hindsight, I would recommend saving money by opting for skip-the-line tickets and exploring the Colosseum at your own pace.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":4,"text":"If you purchase the tickets beforehand, it is fine, since it is quite crowded. I suggest an audio guide to help you get the historical context of the place (too much info). Backpacks are not allowed, but I assume they prohibit the large backpacks (the ones packpackers use when traveling). Regular backpacks are acceptable. Also, another suggestion, do your research before visiting (too much historical context)."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Has to be done! Book in advance, go early if you can. We did the basic tour so I don't know if the \"Full Experience\" tickets are worth it. You get great views of the arena on the basic ticket. Don't turn up more than 15 minutes before your booked time. If you do you will simply be told to stand aside until your actual slot."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"If you‚Äôre visiting Rome a visit to the Colosseum is a must. It is steeped in history. Just walking around the outside is impressive but it is well worth going in and then paying a little more to be able to stand on part of the arena floor and look up at all the terraces, imagining what the gladiators may have seen. Outstanding!"}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Despite the huge crowds you can experience even in the morning this is one of the best sight in Rome and Vatican. Just enjoy the spirit of the place and read something about it before you will visit this place. BTW entrance is at north-west side. As far as I know you have to buy your tickets in advance and do it as soon as you will know your date of visit."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Visited the Colosseum in the late afternoon and stuck around until sunset‚Äîabsolutely worth it. Seeing it in the changing light, especially as the sun hits the stone and casts long shadows, really brings out the scale and atmosphere of the place. It‚Äôs massive, but also surprisingly detailed when you start noticing all the layers and arches.\n\nThe history here is wild‚Äîbuilt nearly 2,000 years ago, it held up to 50,000 people and was used for gladiator fights, mock sea battles, and public spectacles. It‚Äôs crazy to imagine the energy this place once had. Walking through the inside, you can still see parts of the underground chambers where animals and fighters were held. The engineering and design are mind-blowing, especially considering the time it was built.\n\nIt can get crowded, but it‚Äôs 100% worth dealing with that. I recommend booking a ticket in advance or getting one that includes the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill‚Äîmakes for a full day of exploring. Also, go late in the day if you can; it‚Äôs a little quieter and the lighting is beautiful.\n\nA must-see in Rome. Photos don‚Äôt do it justice‚Äîyou really have to stand inside it to feel the scale and history."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Visiting the Colosseum in Rome is an awe-inspiring experience that immerses you in the grandeur and brutality of ancient Rome. This extraordinary historical monument stands as a testament to the ingenuity and engineering prowess of the ancient Romans, but navigating through the crowds and commercialization can be a challenge.\n\nUpon entering the Colosseum, one is immediately struck by its sheer size and architectural magnificence. Constructed over a span of 10 years and completed in 80 AD under the emperor Titus, this iconic amphitheater could accommodate up to 80,000 spectators and hosted a variety of events, including gladiatorial contests, animal hunts, and mock naval battles.\n\nHowever, the reality of modern-day tourism sets in quickly as you realize that your ticket only grants access to the central area of the Colosseum. To explore the upper and lower levels, additional fees are required, adding to the overall cost of the visit. The presence of large crowds can make navigating the Colosseum a daunting task, with long lines and overcrowded passageways full of school groups and tourists groups stopping in so many spots explaining useless opinionated details.\n\nDespite these challenges, the historical significance of the Colosseum is undeniable. As you stand within its ancient walls, you can't help but marvel at the engineering feats of the Romans and the sheer scale of the structure. However, the darker aspects of its history also come to the forefront, prompting reflection on the human and animal cost of the spectacles that once took place within its walls.\n\nIndeed, the Colosseum serves as a poignant reminder of the cruelty and brutality of ancient Roman society. The gladiatorial games, in which slaves, prisoners, and condemned criminals were forced to fight to the death for the entertainment of the masses, stand as a chilling testament to the depths of human depravity. It's a sobering realization that forces us to confront uncomfortable truths about history.\n\nIn spite of the challenges posed by crowds and commercialization, a visit to the Colosseum offers a unique opportunity to connect with the past and contemplate the complexities of human nature. It's a place where history comes alive, inviting visitors to ponder the legacy of ancient Rome and its enduring impact on the world."}

When I tried to explain that I wanted to avoid falling over, due to the aforementioned blood sugar problems, I was interrupted by the Flavian Emperor, because that was 'not his problem'. In hindsight, that was to be expected, he did not have a reputation for preventing casualties.\n\nHe then ordered me to put the food away.

Pickpockets work in teams of 3. Do not put valuables in pockets or a side or back pack or bag. Put everything around your neck in front of your body, even covering with a jacket.

Regular tickets are timed and the line looked long even at 11 am. The only downfall, was limited toilets. If you are doing a guided tour, it does seem to go at a slower pace and the tour guide did slip over some parts. Maybe you can book a tour guide to just get in and then venture on your own if that‚Äôs more of your style.

You can also book it through the official website where you can select the date and timing needed. It is much cheaper.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Tourist Review for the Colosseum Museum\n\nStepping into the Colosseum Museum is like walking through a portal into the grandeur of ancient Rome. The Colosseum itself, a colossal amphitheater completed in AD 80, stands as a testament to the architectural genius and the indomitable spirit of the Roman Empire. Its sheer size and the intricacy of its design never fail to inspire awe. Originally capable of seating up to 50,000 spectators, the Colosseum hosted spectacular events, from gladiatorial combat to public spectacles, cementing its place as a symbol of Rome‚Äôs imperial might and cultural richness.\n\nThe museum, housed within this iconic structure, delves deep into the Colosseum‚Äôs storied past, offering an immersive experience that brings the ancient world vividly to life. Exhibits include intricate models of the Colosseum as it would have looked in its heyday, detailed information about the gladiators and the events they participated in, and fascinating artifacts such as ancient weapons, armor, and even pieces of the original marble seating.\n\nThe **Hypogeum** (underground section), now partially restored, offers a glimpse into the complex network of tunnels and chambers where gladiators prepared for combat and wild animals were housed before being lifted into the arena. This underworld of the Colosseum adds a layer of mystery and intrigue, highlighting the meticulous planning that went into staging the grand spectacles.\n\n**Tourist Tips & Tricks:**\n\n1. **Buy Tickets in Advance**:\n- The Colosseum is one of Rome's most visited attractions, so buying tickets online in advance can save you from long lines and ensure you don‚Äôt miss out. Consider getting a combined ticket that includes the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill for a comprehensive historical experience.\n\n2. **Opt for a Guided Tour**:\n- A guided tour can enrich your visit, providing deeper insights into the history and architecture of the Colosseum. Many tours offer access to restricted areas like the underground chambers and the upper levels, which offer spectacular views of Rome.\n\n3. **Visit Early or Late**:\n- To avoid the largest crowds and the midday heat, try to visit early in the morning or late in the afternoon. These times offer a more relaxed experience and better lighting for photography.\n\n4. **Dress Comfortably**:\n- The Colosseum involves a lot of walking, often over uneven surfaces, so wear comfortable shoes and dress appropriately for the weather. Bringing a hat and sunscreen is advisable, especially during the summer months.\n\n5. **Explore the Surroundings**:\n- Don‚Äôt rush through the Colosseum without exploring the surrounding area. The Roman Forum and Palatine Hill are steeped in history and provide context to the Colosseum‚Äôs grandeur. They offer a picturesque view of ancient ruins and a deeper understanding of Roman life.\n\n6. **Use the Audio Guide**:\n- If you prefer exploring at your own pace, consider renting an audio guide. It provides detailed commentary on various parts of the Colosseum and its history, enhancing your self-guided tour.\n\n7. **Photography Tips**:\n- For the best photos, visit during the golden hours of early morning or late afternoon when the light casts a warm glow on the Colosseum‚Äôs stonework. The interior offers numerous vantage points, so take your time to find unique angles.\n\n8. **Stay Hydrated**:\n- There are limited places to purchase refreshments within the Colosseum, so bring a bottle of water, especially on hot days. There are water fountains where you can refill your bottle, ensuring you stay hydrated during your visit.\n\n9. **Respect the Site**:\n- The Colosseum is a UNESCO World Heritage site and a symbol of ancient history. Respect the preservation efforts by not touching the ruins or straying off the designated paths. Dispose of trash properly and follow the rules to help maintain this historical treasure for future generations.\n\nVisiting the Colosseum Museum is more than just a touristic excursion; it's a journey into the heart of one of history's greatest civilizations.

The colosseum speaks for itself and with a tour guide you can get some much needed context of what exactly you are looking at.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"We stayed near the Colosseum, so it was a landmark in our journey home each day. We booked a small group tour to view it from the inside so here are my recommendations:\n\n1. You don't really need to see the inside. There isn't much more to view but if you are a bloodsport fan and feel like this is a must do, then go for it. It is crowded.\n\n2. The stadium level is just okay. I paid extra for it.\n\n3. The history is fascinating, so I do recommend a guide but it's not necessary. Don't book an overpriced private guide, however, unless it's your jam. I booked a small group through a well known company and there was just 1 other couple with us. And it was way cheaper.\n\n4. The Forum has an interesting history and I recommend pairing your tour with it.\n\n5. I did the first entry time. And it was PACKED. And I walked 18k steps this day. I was so exhausted and don't recommend picking this for your first couple days if you are traveling a far distance (like from the USA)."}

You can take a guided tour or walk through on your own, but either way, purchase tickets through the website in advance. We did enjoy having a guide who was knowledgeable about The Colosseum‚Äôs history and could explain many of the structural and historical pieces or answer questions. The entrance and ticket sales are limited, but it is still quite crowded inside, but there is also plenty of space through our space, and no one was rude during our experience. You can also walk around the outside and take in the view and surrounding monuments.\n\nIf you are in Rome, this is a must-see, and I would suggest a walk through the Roman Forum as well.

You can almost hear the crowds and feel the excitement from back then.\n\nIt's crazy to think about the kinds of things that went on here, from epic battles to wild animal hunts. It's a bit eerie but super fascinating at the same time. And even though it's kind of falling apart (thanks to earthquakes and people stealing bits of it over the years), it's still so impressive.\n\nWalking around, you get this real sense of history, like you're stepping back in time.

The problem with getting a tour guide is you are in a big group among other big groups of people so between trying to listen and take in the views it is difficult. Much easier to go on your own and navigate thru the crowds.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Honestly? Seeing the Colosseum back in July of 2023, was the highlight of my trip to Rome. Being passionate about history anyway, I was amazed at the sheer size of this Roman behemoth of architecture, still towering even after all these years. What's even more impressive, is that it took the ancient Romans only eight years to build and complete! And that's without all the tools and machinery we have in today's modern society!\n\nMy friend and I booked the tickets in advance as we imagined, being a popular attraction, it would be VERY difficult to purchase tickets on the actual day. Now I don't know myself, but it 'may' be possible to get them on the day. However, if you want to be on the safe side, it may be best to purchase tickets beforehand. That way, you haven't got to worry about queueing up in potentially massive queues and tickets being sold out before you have a chance to get one. I heard of cancellations and people being able to get last minute tickets, but I cannot be sure on this one. It's always best to check and ensure you buy tickets from the mains sites, as I believe there are a few scam websites out there.\n\nWe had a bit of a wait for our tour guide, however we were early in all fairness. So we relaxed in the shade, just across the way from the Colosseum until they had arrived. Getting into the Colosseum was pretty swift (the advantage of having purchased tickets beforehand), bypassing the usual queues and passing through the security checkpoint, before actually entering into the main part of the building itself. Getting up-close and personal with a piece of history like this, was pretty indescribable. Knowing that many Roman citizens once walked through these corridors, to bear witness to the spectacles that were to unfold on the arena floor. Speaking of, our ticket gave us access to part of the floor, where the gladiators once stood, looked upon by cheering crowds... quite the experience! From that area, we also got to take a look down into the floor below, to see where those fighters would be waiting and preparing themselves, ready to take the stage.\n\nAfter the tour, we were free to explore the Colosseum at our own pace, which was really nice. We took some time, to look out from the upper floors onto the arena and the seating area, trying to imagine what chaos and excitement would have filled this once packed amphitheatre all those years ago. It was worth the money and if you're into history and all things ancient Rome, then I'd definitely give it a go!"}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Ancient ruin of the famous gladiator arena. It's an impressive sight, and despite the huge crowds you can really immerse yourself in the feeling of being a gladiator or spectator in ancient times. A must do when in Rome.\n\nThere's a lack of restrooms though, and with a lot of crowds you might have a hard time without suffering a significant wait. So would recommend to have that in mind. Also, booking tickets in advance is a must."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":4,"text":"An amazing place rich with history! The sights are absolutely breathtaking. One thing to note is that if you don't have a guided tour, you'll have to download the official app for an audio guide. The downside is that the app is kind of janky and not clear with instructions/locations that the audio is referring to. There was a huge line to get in (I went in at 8 am) but it moved quickly and I already had my ticket. The Coliseum was very crowded so consider that when making your reservations."}

However, my family had a bad experience from a private tour lady although we were not her customers. My family and a couple were merged with a private tour without given a choice at the meeting point. We walked together but kept a distance. The private tour lady was so rude that she yelled at my mom and me when we were trying to take a picture as we were in the way of her customers‚Äô cameras. We didn‚Äôt see her group as they were behind us from a distance, but how hard it would be to give us 3 seconds to finish the picture? We were forced to stop taking a picture in the middle and moved away. She also kept repeating her tour is a private tour at the beginning, making us feel uncomfortable. We wish they never merged us with a private tour and made us feel like second class citizens for our once of a life time family trip."}

It's just a few steps from the Coloseum Metro station.\n\nWe did not book the tickets online and it took about 15-20 minutes to get tickets from the counter. It was 16 euros per person. Kids below 11 are free. They accept debit/credit cards only. No cash payment accepted. An identity proof or a digital copy of the same is needed to buy the ticket from the counter. The lady infront of me did not have anything on her and they refused her a ticket. The wait time for ticket at counter could be significantly longer in summer. The rates on the official website are the same as physical counter, so makes sense to buy them in advance.\n\nWith the ticket, it took just a few minutes to enter the building. There are counters to buy a audio/video guide (coated us 6euros). From there on, it's up to you to pace your trip.\n\nAmple places to fill in your water bottles.

The business died down around 18:00 after which we could more freely walk around.\n\nWe weren't allowed to visit the arena part because we didn't buy a 'full experience' ticket, which we didn't know was a possibility when at the ticket kiosk (there were no options given).

Its grandeur and scale are a testament to the engineering genius of the Romans.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Well, you have all seen it. It is something like the symbol of the Ancient Roman empire, and it is as imposant as you would expect! The venue is huge, you can walk only over some parts of the first and second levels(floors) but it's enough to get the impression. Many groups and tourists, even in the low season, but I managed to book my ticket online and get inside for 5 minutes in late November, so it's quite doable. In the summer, I think this is hardly an option. They have reopened a ticket office to get phisical tickets, although the official site tells you there is only an online booking service since Covid 19. However, I would recommend the online booking - it's fast and easy, but it will charge you 3 euros more, so in the end the 16 euros ticket is actually 19. Just keep that in mind. Also, don't forget to bring an ID document with you, they ask at the entrance to see if it matches the name of the ticket holder. Overall, it may seem expensive but given it is combined with the Forum and Palatine hill sites, it is a very good value for money. The visit will take you more than 3 hours so go earlier to get all venues open and see them. The temples and museums in the Forum and Palatine close at 3pm in the winter, so you may miss to see them if you come late. Enjoy:)"}

The second part of the tour was during the day and it included a tour of the inside of the Colosseum. It was at the moment of walking of through the entrance that an overwhelming sense of amazement set in. The Roman architects, engineers, and laborers were of great vision and skill.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"The Colosseum in Italy is a breathtaking marvel of ancient architecture, and it truly lives up to its reputation. Here are three things I absolutely loved:\n\nHistorical Grandeur: The Colosseum's rich history is palpable as you walk through its ancient corridors. It's a mesmerizing journey back in time to the days of gladiators and grand spectacles.\n\nArchitectural Splendor: The sheer size and scale of the Colosseum are awe-inspiring. The precision and engineering involved in its construction are a testament to the craftsmanship of the time.\n\nSpectacular Views: Climb to the upper levels for panoramic views of Rome. The scenery is nothing short of spectacular, offering a unique perspective of the city.\n\nNow, for the not-so-great aspects:\n\nCrowds: The Colosseum is understandably popular, which means large crowds. It can get incredibly crowded, making it a bit challenging to fully immerse yourself in the experience.\n\nRestoration Work: While necessary, the ongoing restoration work can sometimes detract from the full visual experience. Scaffolding and repair materials can be seen in certain areas.\n\nMy suggestion: Consider booking a guided tour to bypass the lines and gain a deeper understanding of the history and architecture. Also, try to visit during off-peak hours for a more intimate experience.\n\nIn the end, the Colosseum is an extraordinary testament to human achievement, and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Rome."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"The Colosseum loomed large on our Rome itinerary, and for good reason! Three of us opted for a guided tour, snagging tickets for the 10:00 AM slot. It proved to be a wise decision. Our guide's knowledge brought the ancient amphitheater to life, weaving tales of gladiatorial combat and Roman spectacle that sent shivers down our spines.\nThe tour itself was well-paced, allowing ample time to soak in the grandeur of the Colosseum's architecture. We marveled at the intricate engineering, the sheer scale, and the countless stories etched into its very stones.\nAfter the tour concluded, we couldn't resist snapping photos from every angle, both inside and out. Capturing the Colosseum's magnificence in our own frames was an incredible feeling, a souvenir far more valuable than any trinket.\nEven with the tour group, there were manageable crowds, and the 10:00 AM start time ensured we avoided the very cold weather. Overall, the Colosseum experience was a highlight of our Roman adventure, and the guided tour significantly enriched our understanding of this historical wonder."}

They gave us a discount, but it didn't allow us the time to rebook for the underground, which was very disappointing.

It's definitely a place you should visit if you're coming to Rome the first time, but don't set your expectations too high because you may be a little disappointed. If you have the budget, go for the catacombs ticket, as that would provide a better immersive experience than going only through the regular tour.

Tickets sell out very quickly, so book early. Check your the terms and conditions of your ticket. Some companies email you a timed collection ticket, which you cannot use to enter the area. You have to take it to a set point to collect the actual entry ticket. You must arrive by the stated collection time, or they will refuse to issue you the entry ticket. I saw several people caught out by this.\nThere are several types of tickets that allow you access to different areas, so make sure you get the one you want.\nThe area contains the Colosseum, the Forum, and Palatine Hill. It is huge and takes a long time to get around. The entry tickets are timed, and I strongly suggest getting a morning one so you have time to see everything.\nYou have an entry time to the Colosseum. They allow fifteen minutes of leeway on either side of the time. It takes a while to actually get into the building. Large bags are banned, though no one stopped me, and I had a large rucksack on.\nInside, there is a lift for people with a disability. Everyone else uses the stairs to access the different levels.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"There are several ticket options. You can even buy tickets to get to the arena. The standard ticket allows you to the permanent exhibition on the second floor and first and second floors of the Coliseum. Which was honestly enough to see everything worth seeing. You can see hallways, stage, arena and the labyrinth. Other parts of the building are closed, so basically you can see everything with the standard ticket. Definitely worth seeing. A lot of groups creating lines to get inside and crowds inside of the exhibition so you will have to fight your way to the exhibition items. If you purchase individual tickets then you will enter the coliseum through the separate entrance which doesn‚Äôt have lines. Better to buy tickets in advance as they can be sold out quickly."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"An icon of the city and history. If you can afford to, get a guided tour as you will learn so much more about the history and the place. The tickets also get you entry into the Roman Forum gardens which, in my opinion, are even better. Give yourselves at least half a day to see both comfortably."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":3,"text":"The Colosseum is spectacular and enormous, but my most impressive view was from the outside, when we came up the stairs out of the metro station, and - WOW - there it was!  Going inside was incredibly crowded and made me feel claustrophobic.  We were packed in like sardines, waiting for brief turns at the railings to take pictures, as we shuffled in lines through the tunnels from one viewpoint to the next.  We visited at 1pm on a Friday in March and for entry had to stand in line for 20 minutes, having our tickets (bought several days earlier) checked three times, plus the check of our IDs and the metal detector.  If I was showing friends around Rome, I wouldn't bother buying tickets and going inside.  Instead, we would walk around the outside, take pictures, and then move on to see other fun things in Rome that are less congested."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":3,"text":"One of the \"must see's\" when visiting Rome. But having seen it once is all that is necessary.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"Not sure if it needs saying, but the Colosseum is a must see if you are visiting Rome. We booked a skip-the-line tour which was well worth it - queues were massive by 10am, but we were straight to the front with our guide. However, if you're on a budget it is worth noting the entrance is free on the first Sunday of each month across lots of major landmarks in Rome, and including the Colosseum. We visited on a Monday, but enjoyed free entry to the Pantheon the day before."}

In order to visit the place we were expected to pay for a whole new ticket. Understanding this is a business, it was also an innocent mistake. Such a shame that hundreds of years and they are still after so much money. Specifically a big thank you to the supervisor on the day who also provided no assistance in this service.

In a nutshell it is extremely busy to the point you can't move in some places. Large touring groups make it even worse trying to see anything.  Certain areas like underground areas require additional tickets which are extremely difficult/ impossible to get hold of.  When these tickets are released they are immediately sold out due to bots buying them up for these tour groups. I note they have been fined heavily for allowing this to happen but are obviously still allowing the practice. Disappointing visit"}

Highly recommended both as a place to visit. When in Rome."}

For availability of tickets, we did book in advance, one month depend on website availability, only chance for us, was Italian guided tour. English and Spanish are the ones booked the most, for us was not a problem because we do understand Italian too. However some people had to book Italian, even though they didn‚Äôt understand it only to get the chance of the full experience. So my recommendation: 1 book in advance, full experience package, comfortable shoes and clothe, sandals are really a bad idea, small package/purse, handbags, bring water. If summer try to get it first thing in the morning because it is really hot, or maybe was due to the hot weather warning."}

Cost to visit for adults is 18euro for standard ticket- if you would like to visit the arena floor check their website and book months in advance.

We didn't queue to enter the Colosseum but the Roman hill and grounds did have a long queue and with the heavy rain decided to not wait any longer to enter. The exhibition is available in English as you walk around the Colosseum. Steps are uneven and can be steep in places. There is an elevator for those who would find the steps a challenge. The website says no bags allowed inside the Colosseum and we didn't take a bag but many people did which was confusing. Free water refills available just outside the Colosseum (available throughout the city). Visited in Jan 2025."}

It's also worth taking a walk round the outside of the place. There's a toilet on the outside you can use for a few Euro cents; the queues to get into the Colosseum can be quite long though so pre-purchasing tickets before getting there is helpful; it can also get quite crowded though this isn't surprising.\n\nOverall a visit to Rome wouldn't be complete without at least one visit here."}

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"This was probably our favorite tour in Rome! We had a guide for just the three of us. She provided headsets so we could easily hear her commentary. We started out on the lower levels. Our guide definitely brought the entire Colosseum experience to life. She explained to us how many moving parts it had and how each part was accomplished. It was truly amazing to see all of the various rooms as well as the tracks used to raise and lower platforms with animals, or fighters on them. We then went to the upper levels of the coliseum and discussed The experiences of both the rich and poor Romans. We talked about how the coliseum fit into Roman culture and politics. Both my husband and I are visually impaired. Our guide was able to let us touch some of the art and carvings which decorated the Colosseum. She directed us to a placard that had English, Italian, and braille descriptions of the coliseum. It also had a raised diagram which we could touch to get a better feeling for how the parts of the Colosseum that we explored fit together to form a whole. She was very thorough and we enjoyed it immensely. I wish I could locate her card so I could share her name, she was wonderful!"}

Its grand opening in 80 AD featured 100 days of gladiator games.

Despite serving as a fortress and quarry in the 18th century, only the north side and underground passages remain today.

We bought a 3.30pm ticket and we were only allowed to enter 10 minutes before the allocated time. I believe this is to ensure the colosseum is not too crowded.\n\nDespite the control, the main drawback for me was the crowd. It is not too difficult to navigate around as the colosseum is huge. However, the popular spots are usually full of tourists, either queuing for pictures or just admiring its beauty.\n\nThe colosseum‚Äôs architecture is something to behold.

I would recommend buying those because you can have access to a bigger part of the colosseum. Otherwise, the normal ticket should be fine.\n\nBut, watching the colosseum from the outside is enough to have the idea of the building.

Unfortunately the staff was a little aggressive and they only spoke Italian. They escorted us out and we never found out what was wrong.

The Colosseum which was commissioned by Emperor Vespasian in AD 72, could hold an estimated having an average audience of some 65,000. It was commonly used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology.\n\nThe day we visited this architectural masterpiece it rained heavily for about 10 minutes. There was no care for such phenomena and the staff was not helpful at all. There was a tent near the entrance to the Colosseum and the crowd took refuge there but the staff tried to shoo them away shouting and push them to the rain urging them to buy umbrellas. Nevertheless it is worth visiting even with some difficulties. The night is partially lit and it is special, but if you can only go once to visit it, prefer during the day."}
{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"The Colosseum in Rome stands as an awe-inspiring testament to the grandeur of ancient Roman engineering and architecture. Words and pictures can only capture a fraction of its magnificence; it's an experience that truly must be witnessed in person to be fully appreciated. The colossal size of this amphitheater, once capable of holding 50,000 spectators, is beyond comprehension until you stand in its shadow. Walking through the same archways that ancient Romans once did, you can feel the weight of history and imagine the roars of the crowd as gladiators battled ferociously below. The sheer scale of the Colosseum's structure, combined with its intricate details, leaves visitors in awe, reminding us of the incredible feats accomplished by our ancestors.

{"place":"Colosseum","rating":5,"text":"The Colosseum is more than just an ancient amphitheater built in the 1st century‚Äîit's a symbol of Rome. Naturally, it's one of the most popular monuments in town, so do yourself a favor and grab tickets at the Forum or Palatine nearby, then use those to bypass the impossibly long ticket lines at the Colosseum.\n\nThe place is undeniably magnificent from the outside. Standing 160 feet tall and made of brick, concrete, and limestone, the Colosseum is an awe-inspiring testament to Roman building. Visitors report mixed reviews of the interior, which was picked over by looters pretty intensely for more than 1,000 years. To get the most out of a trip inside, book a special visit to the substructure (basically the backstage area where people and animals waited to be brought onstage), the third tier, and the belvedere via the Colosseum's website.\nThe Colosseum pulls in several million visitors a year and, like the Vatican Museums and Trevi Fountain, people visit it whether they're spending six hours or six days in town. The crowd is a mix of individuals and tour groups varying in size."}
