Their location is absolutely perfect and their menu advertise tapas for $3.50 which they are but the portions are small the quality is very low. I initially ordered tap water which they would not serve me and when I received the bill I understood why for a small bottle of water is $3.95 . I would not recommend this place.",

The restaurant was advertising tapas for â‚¬3.50, but when they arrived the portions were microscopic. To add insult to injury, we were then charged â‚¬3.95 for a basket of stale bread, â‚¬3.95 x2 for 0.5l of water and â‚¬3.95 each for an espresso and a cafe con leche. I left feeling more hungry than when I went in and thoroughly ripped off. The worst of Malaga. Avoid!",

We were also surprised to be charged â‚¬4 for a basic, dry breadbasket that was just brought to the table without being informed it wasn't complimentary. The beer was overpriced compared to other better spots in town.\nSeems like a typical tourist trap.\nSave your moneyâ€”donâ€™t waste your time here! There are plenty of better places in the city.",

You see the sign advertising low price tapas and sit down expecting low/average prices, they ask you first what do you want to drink and only after they bring you the menu with no drinks on it only food. Later they charge you 4 euros for a coffee. Also their coffee is terrible.",

    "text": "Unfortunately I have to agree with mostt of the other reviews. THe tapas portions were small and all out of a packet. Microwaved croquettes were almost inedible and 3.95E for a coke is almost theft 26E overall was completely over the top. The restaurant is in a good position and management simply seem to ignore the reviews as they know that tourists frequenting the area do so on impulse rather than reading reviews. This is exactly what we did.",

When it comes to the food - ham was really good, croquetes also. Patatas bravas very bad because of dry potatoes cooked some time ago. Nice location when you seat outside. Some good staff doing their hard job to serve. I would never rate them so low as they have.",

    "text": "Definitely a tourist trap. The tapas were low quality .. tasteless food. â€“ dry, cold potatoes with no flavour. I paid â‚¬7 for a single glass of fresh orange juice, which I had for Â£3.50 just ten minutes earlier somewhere else. The place is crowded only because itâ€™s in a spot thatâ€™s easy to stumble upon â€“ not because itâ€™s actually good. Wouldnâ€™t recommend.",
